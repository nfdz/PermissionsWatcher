# PermissionsWatcher

Since Marshmallow (6.0), Android asks for permissions to access some special APIs in a context where they are justified. 

**Why do apps keep these acquired permissions forever?**

This tool is very simple. It shows a warning for applications with changes (acquired permissions) and alerts the user with a notification as soon as possible (real time mode) or once a day (report mode).
